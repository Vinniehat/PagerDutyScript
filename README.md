# PagerDutyScript
<br>

This is a Node.JS script made to ping an IP every X seconds, and on fail, it will send an alert to PagerDuty once. It will continually check to see if the server comes back online, and if so, it sends another alert.

It's pretty simple. You can change the IP, Port, Key, Interval, and Message if you'd like. Feel free to submit PRs!
